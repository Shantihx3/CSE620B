# Installing QGIS

### 1. Install QGIS

I started by installing QGIS

![QGIS_install](../images/qgis_installed.png)

### 2. Find a region in Overpass Turbo

I then ran the following query to find houses around my high school

```
/*
This has been generated by the overpass-turbo wizard.
The original search was:
“house”
*/
[out:json][timeout:25];
// gather results
(
  // query part for: “house”
  way["building"="house"]({{bbox}});
  relation["building"="house"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out body;
>;
out skel qt;
```

### 3. Download High Res Orthoimagery

Downloaded NAIP ID `M_4208750_SW_16_060_20190809`...

### 4. Render with orthoimagery and vector data

...and ended up with all houses overlaid on an image of my high school and the surrounding area.
